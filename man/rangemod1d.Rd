\title{Range Cohesion Model for Ordered (and Non-spatial) Data}
\usage{
rangemod1d(spmat, var = NULL, cohesion = T, first = FALSE,
  degen = FALSE, rsize = c("observed", "unif"), reps)
}
\arguments{
\item{spmat}{a site by species matrix or data frame with species in columns}

\item{var}{an optional vector containing explanatory variable for
constraining the randomization. It should be NULL when absent}

\item{cohesion}{If true, species distributions are without gaps
i.e. result is range cohesion, otherwise it is range scatter}

\item{first}{If TRUE, 'var' is used while choosing the first occurence as
well.if 'var' is null, first is always set 'FALSE'}

\item{degen}{If true, each randomized site by species matrix is saved and
provided in output}

\item{rsize}{which rangesizes to use for simulation, can be an integer
vector of same length as number of species(collumns) or either
'observed' or'unif'. See details for explanations}

\item{reps}{number of replicates}
}
\value{
If degen is FALSE, a data frame with four colums for mean, SD and
       confidence intervals of expected richness

\itemize{
 \item{"mod.rich"}{ mean richness of each site}
 \item{"mod.sd"}{ standard deviation of species richness}
 \item{"q2.5"}{ lower limit of the confidence interval}
 \item{"q97.5"}{ upper limit of the confidence interval}
}
       If degen is TRUE, then a list containing above data frame and a list
       of all the randomized matrices
}
\description{
rangemod1d takes observed site by species matrix and returns
              expected species richness values of each site
}
\details{
rangemod1d impliments simulations used by Rahbeck et.al (2007) to
         data which are only in form of a site by species matrix and without
         any spatial information. A list similar to an nb object of spdep can
         prepared according to order in which the rows (sites) are arranged.
         A manually prepared list of neighbours for each site can also be
         used.It is important that each site must have at least one neighbour.
         'rsize' provides a vector of rangesizes.It can be 'unif' -
          ranges are drawn from a uniform distribution,between 1 to
         number of sites or 'observed' - rangesize
         of each species is exactly the same as in the observed matrix.
         Alternatively a it can also be a user specified integer vector, of
         same length as number of species.
