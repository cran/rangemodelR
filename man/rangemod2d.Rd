\title{Range Cohesion Models for Spatial Polygon Grids}
\usage{
rangemod2d(spmat, shp, field, nb, rsize = c("observed", "unif"), var = NULL,
  reps, degen = FALSE, first = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{spmat}{a site by species matrix or data frame with species in columns}

\item{shp}{shapefile of sites where species occurences are recorded}

\item{field}{a number or character vector indicating which column in the dbf
of shapefile is the unique id}

\item{nb}{a neighbour object similar to one generated from
\code{\link[spdep]{poly2nb}} of \pkg{\link[spdep]{spdep}}
If 'nb' is NA then result is range scatter}

\item{rsize}{which rangesizes to use for simulation, can be an integer vector
of same length as number of species(collumns)
or either 'observed' or'unif'. See details for explanations}

\item{var}{an optional vector containing explanatory variable for
constraining the randomization}

\item{reps}{number of replicates}

\item{degen}{If true, each randomized site by species matrix is saved and
provided in output}

\item{first}{If true, 'var' is used while choosing the first occurence as
well.if 'var' is null, first is always set 'FALSE'}
}
\value{
A list containing following elements:
\itemize{
 \item{"out.df"}{ a data frame with four columns for mean, standard
                  deviation, lower and upper limits of confidence intervals
                  of predicted species richness }
 \item{"out.shp"}{ same as the input shapefile with additional the four
                   colums of 'out.df' in attribute table}
 \item{"degenerate.matrices"} {a list of all the randomized matrices(only
                               present if 'degen' is TRUE)}
 }
}
\description{
rangemod2d takes observed site by species matrix and returns
              expected species richness values of each site based on user
              defined neighbour relationships.
}
\details{
rangemod2d impliments simulations used by Rahbeck et.al. (2007) to
         species distribution data on a continuous grid. In 'spmat' the sites
         (rows) represent each cell in the grid.The species occurences across
         sites are randomly spread maintaining strict range cohesion.
         A neighbour object is used to limit the choice
         of cells during random selctions to immidiate neighbours. Options
         for creating four cell (rook) or eight cell (queen) neighbours can
         be accessed while creating the 'nb' object, (typically from package
         \pkg{\link[spdep]{spdep}}). The randomisation proceeds by selecting a
         single site,(weighted by 'var' if provided, and first is TRUE), and
         then continues selecting one site at a time from a vector of
         available neighbours taken from 'nb' and weighted by 'var' if
         provided. The vector of available sites is updated after each site
         is selected.
