#' Polygon Grid Roughly Located on Central India
#'
#' A grid with 100 cells, each \eqn{1^0} by \eqn{1^0} in size roughly located on
#' central India. Each cell is assigned a hypothetical assemblage of varying
#' species richness from a hypothetical regional pool of 20 species.
#' The attribute table of the shape file has one uniqe id field observed species
#' richness of each cell and one expanatory variable. Observed species richness
#' is generated by assigning a randomly selected number of species among the 20
#' species in the regional pool.
#' \itemize{
#'    \item ID  a unique id field
#'    \item obs_rich  observed species richness
#'    \item trend  a variable with spatial trend obtained using a linear function
#'                of coordinates}
